/// <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/nvbio">NVBIO</a> is a library of reusable components designed by <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a> to accelerate bioinformatics applications
/// using <i>CUDA</i>. Though it is specifically designed to unleash the power of <i>NVIDIA</i> <b>GPU</b>s,
/// most of its components are completely cross-platform and can be used both from host C++ and device
/// CUDA code.
///\par
/// The purpose of NVBIO is twofold: it can be thought of both as a solid basis to build new, modern applications targeting
/// GPUs, which deferring the core computations to a library will always automatically and transparently benefit from new
/// advances in GPU computing, and as example material to design novel bioinformatics algorithms for massively parallel architectures.
///\par
/// Additionally, NVBIO contains a suite of applications built on top of it, including a re-engineered
/// implementation of the famous <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">Bowtie2</a> short read aligner.
/// Unlike many prototypes, nvBowtie is an attempt to build an industrial strength aligner, reproducing most of Bowtie2's
/// original features as well as adding a few more, such as efficient support for direct BAM (and soon CRAM) output.
///\par
/// Similarly, it contains the fastest BWT builders for strings and string-sets available to date.
/// NVBIO can in fact perform the BWT of individual strings containing several billion characters or string-sets containing
/// up to ~100 billion symbols at an unprecedented speed of roughly <i>80M symbols/s</i>, on a single Tesla K40.
