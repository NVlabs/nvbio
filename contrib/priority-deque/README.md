Priority-Deque

==============



This project is my implementation of a double-ended priority queue (a priority deque) as a C++ class template.

Goals:
Interface similar to STL's priority_queue.
Performance competitive with STL's priority_queue.
Provide the strongest exception-safety guarantee possible without compromising performance.
